            <p>I am a third year student at New York City College of Technology, CUNY and majoring in data science. I am part of the 8th cohort of CUNY Tech Prep. I am passionate about learning more about this world through different lenses especially through data.</p>
            <p id='message'>My goal is to discover, analyze and harness — the power of 'data'. Data is undoubtedly the new gold of the era we live in.</p>
            <p>When I am not in front of a screen, I’m most likely enjoying the local food and wonderful weather while reading or listening to music</p>
